        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p>This game is based on the TV show "Deal or No Deal". There are 2 players: the banker and the contestant.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th style="text-align:center">Banker</th>
                <td>
                    <p>The aim of the game is to "buy" the player's briefcase, while preventing the player from winning
                        the grand prize. You want to cut losses.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Watch the values that the player chooses as he plays the game.</li>
                        <li>When the player is asked "Deal or No Deal", you are to offer a price to the player on how
                            much you are willing to buy his briefcase for.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You and the player have no idea how much money is in the player's briefcase.</li>
                        <li>You have no idea how the values are jumbled in the remaining briefcase.</li>
                        <li>As the banker, you want to buy the player's briefcase for less than it is worth.</li>
                    </ul>

            </tr>

                    <p>The aim of the game is to get the best deal out of the game.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You start off with 13 briefcases, with all values shuffled randomly. You select a briefcase,
                            and that briefcase will be set aside in one corner. This is the player's briefcase.</li>
                        <li>Pick 5 briefcases, with each briefcase selected showing its value. The value will also be
                            strikethrough at the value sidebar at the bottom of the game.</li>
                        <li>After picking 5 briefcases, you are asked "Deal or No Deal". This is when the banker
                            (sitting beside you) gives you an amount, and you have the option of deciding between making
                            a deal with the banker or rejecting the banker's deal.</li>
                        <li>Whenever you make a deal with the banker, the game ends and all values are shown.</li>
                        <li>If you reject the banker's deal, the game continues, from "Select 3 briefcases" to "Select 2
                            briefcases" to "Select 1 briefcase", until you have one briefcase left on screen. Each time
                            a set of instructions is complete, the question "Deal or No Deal" appears again.</li>
                        <li>If up till now, you selected "No Deal", you are then asked if you want to swap briefcases.
                            After answering that question, the values are shown and you have the option to Play Again.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
